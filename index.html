  <h1>
    Web-Seption
  </h1>
  <p>Here,I will teach you the basics of making a website (coding, to "hosting"), and hopefully you'll be able to replicate this website yourself!</p>
  <br>
  <nav>
   <a href="https://godhelpmejoemama.github.io/index.html">Main</a>
   <a href="https://godhelpmejoemama.github.io/About.html">About</a>
   
   
  </nav>
  <h2>"Coding"!</h2>
  <h3>
    Step 1
  </h3>
  <p>
    You'll need to create 1 file, "YourWebsite.html".This can be named anything, as long as it has <u>".html"</u> at the end.
    Next, you'll need to find a hosting provider you hope to host this on.
    <br> <br>
    I picked <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a>.
    <br> <br>
    Github pages is built right into Github, so if you are already famier with the platform, it's much easier to use. And as another bonus,<u>it's completely free!</u>
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3>Step 2</h3>
  <p>
    So you'll need to set up your files, it shoud look like <a href="https://github.com/GodHelpMeJoeMama/GodHelpMeJoeMama.github.io/blob/master/Step2.html" target="_blank">this</a>, which should look like <a href="https://godhelpmejoemama.github.io/Step2.html" target="_blank">this</a> (aka, blank).
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3>Step 3</h3>
  <p>HTML (which is what we'll start with), makes pretty <b>bare bones sites</b>. The whole idea of HTML is it's structure, which is like a "tree". The coding system uses "Tags", which is anything betwen the &#60;_&#62; and the &#60;/_&#62;. A tag always has a start and an end.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your "Head" tag is everything the site runs when you open it. This would hold scripts, CSS (we'll get to this), titles, logos, and more!
  </p>
  <p>Your "Body" tag is what we actually put stuff in, so like headers, paragraphs, links, and more.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Step 4</h3>
  <p>Lets put some basic stuff on the site now. Put a &#60;p&#62;_&#60;/p&#62; tag (paragraph tag). With this tag, we can now put basic text in the page. Just put some random stuff inbetween the two tags. Your code should now look like <a href="https://github.com/GodHelpMeJoeMama/GodHelpMeJoeMama.github.io/blob/master/Step4.html" target="_blank">this</a>, which will look like <a href="https://godhelpmejoemama.github.io/Step4.html" target="_blank">this</a> when you open it up in your browser.</p>
  <p>Paragraphs are pretty neat in HTML, they're the best way to put in text. By default, paragrpahs automatically put a line between other paragraphs lines. Actually, most the the text (including this message), is nested inside of a paragraph tag. The only diffrence is that I have made them look diffrent though CSS, but we'll get to that later.</p>
  <h3>Step 5</h3>
  <p>Now that you've made your first tag (and message), it's time to learn new tags. There's the &#60;h&#62; tags (also known as the "header" tag), which is: &#60;h1&#62;, &#60;h2&#62;, &#60;h3&#62;, &#60;h4&#62;, and &#60;h5&#62;. All of these header tags have predetermined size. h1 is the biggest, while h5 is the smallest. You can use these to make things on your site. Each of the "Step" things on the screen are headers, along with the "Web-Seption" at the top.</p>
  <p>With HTML being such a widespread "language", there are many other tags that you can find. I'd suggest going to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp" target="_blank">www.w3schools.com/</a> to find more tags that you can use, like the &#60;b&#62; (bold) tag, &#60;u&#62; (underline) tag, and more!</p>
  <h3>Step 6</h3>
  <p>This is now the end of the HTML section that we're going to do. You should already hae some basic stuff set up, like: ____, and now you need to use more complicated tags. Tags such as the &#60;a&#62; tag (link or hyperlink), uses "Attributes". These attributes can say lots of things, but for now, we're just going to look at the &#60;a&#62; tag. If you look on the w3school page for it, you'll see one of it's attributes is "href". This tag can be used to tell the client that this link should send you to x website when you click it. If you properly do this, the code should look like <a href="https://github.com/GodHelpMeJoeMama/GodHelpMeJoeMama.github.io/blob/master/Step6.html" target="_blank">this</a>, and the site should look like <a href="https://godhelpmejoemama.github.io/Step6.html" target="_blank">this</a></p>
  <p>Many diffrent tags use attributes, so I'd suggest looking through their page on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp" target="_blank">www.w3schools.com/</a> before using it.</p>
  <h3>Step 7</h3>
  <p>Finally, the slightly more interesting stuff, also known as "CSS". "CSS" is a language that is made to make HTML look nicer, so this page doesn't just look like a peice of printed paper. You can do many things such as changing the background, changing fonts, moving text, and more!</p>
